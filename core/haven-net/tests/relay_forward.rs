//! The connection-relay proof: Alice's sealed post reaches Bob **through a relay**,
//! and the relay never opens the payload.
//!
//! Topology: Alice and Bob never exchange a direct address. Alice dials only the
//! **relay**, hands it a mesh-relay frame addressed to Bob, and the relay forwards the
//! opaque payload to Bob. Bob opens it with his own keys — proving the relay moved
//! ciphertext it could not read, between two peers that weren't directly wired up.
